# _**Ref Report**_


## _**About**_


This application was designed as a tool for use by Amateur referees. My son is keen to become a referee, 
and we found that other than writing the details in a notebook which are prone to being lost or misplaced,
there was nothing else of use to him to keep a record of the match details. I wanted to design a tool to help
him and other referrees to make a record of the game they have just taken charge of as soon as they get back
to the dressing room. <br>
Users are able to register a new account, login to their account where they can submit a new report, view all 
existing reports and also edit and delete reports as necessary. <br>

## _**About**_


This application was designed as a tool for use by Amateur referees. My son is keen to become a referee, 
and we found that other than writing the details in a notebook which are prone to being lost or misplaced,
there was nothing else of use to him to keep a record of the match details. I wanted to design a tool to help
him and other referrees to make a record of the game they have just taken charge of as soon as they get back
to the dressing room. <br>
Users are able to register a new account, login to their account where they can submit a new report, view all 
existing reports and also edit and delete reports as necessary. <br>

The deployed website can be viewed here - [Ref Report](https://adamp-ref-report.herokuapp.com/)


## _**UX**_ 

The application was designed to be easy and straight forward to use. I created a simple homepage with a small
amount of information about the application, and also a link for new users to register an account. <br>
The application is easy to navigate by either using the menu links in the header, or using the side navigation bar on smaller
devices. <br>
I designed the application to have a consistent look to each page, the forms are the same throughout whether logging in or 
submitting a report, and each page has a familiar feel to it.

### _**Target Audience**_ 

The application is aimed at but not restricted to the following users :

* Young amateur referees.
* Senior amateur referees.
* Football coaches who wish to keep a record of their matches.
* Football fans to keep a track of their favourite team.
